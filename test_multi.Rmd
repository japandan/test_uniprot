**Load/Generate overlap matrices and taxonomic groups**

Load the RData files that contain the organism_metadata dataframe and the
overlap_mat_for_scoring dataframe.
```{r load-matrices-and-taxon-groups}
# #must create variable named organism_metadata
# metadata_file <-file.choose() 
#metadata_file <- "organism_metadata.RData"
#load(metadata_file)
# #must create variable named overlap_mat_for_scoring
#scoring_overlap_file <- file.choose()
#scoring_overlap_file <- "overlap_mat_for_scoring.RData"
#load(scoring_overlap_file)
```


Un-comment (Select lines then Ctrl-Shift-C) and run the below chunk if you don't
have the necessary matrices already saved. They can be saved and re-used until
new organisms are added to the database. Save the overlap_mat_for_scoring and
organism_metadata dataframes.
```{r generate-matrices-and-taxon-groups}
organism_metadata <- CandidateSearchDatabase::organism_info(conn_list)

# Use this matrix for taxonomic groups
overlap_mat <- CandidateSearchDatabase::overlap_coefficients(conn_list) %>%
  column_to_rownames("kegg_id") %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 1.)

# Use this matrix for scoring
overlap_mat_for_scoring <-
  CandidateSearchDatabase::overlap_coefficients_strong(conn_list) %>%
  column_to_rownames("kegg_id") %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 1.)

grouping <- CandidateSearchDatabase::leader_similarity_cluster(
  as.matrix(overlap_mat),
  minimum_overlap_coefficent = .5
)

organism_metadata <- organism_metadata %>%
  left_join(
    grouping,
    by=c("kegg_id" = "org_id")
  )
rm(grouping)

#ADD this to save files
# save( overlap_mat, file="overlap_mat.RData")
# save( overlap_mat_for_scoring, file="overlap_mat_for_scoring.RData")
# save( organism_metadata, file="organism_metadata.RData")
```


# Generate Tags from PEAKS

PEAKS generates a csv which is named `de novo peptides.csv` by default. It can
contain results from multiple source files. `batch_PEAKS_tags()` will filter the
PSMs by ALC and peptide length then split them by Source File and generate tags
on each file's PSMs individually.
    
The function will write RData files (one for each file in the Source.File
column), containing the results in the `output_dir`.
    
If `return_tags = TRUE` the function will return a list of dataframes, one for
each file in the Source.File column. These dataframes can be used as the input
for the next step of MARLOWE.

```{r generate-PEAKS-tags}
#peaks_output_path <- choose.files(caption = "Select PEAKS de novo output csv", multi = FALSE)
#make sure to use the Linux version of peaks_to_marlowe.R!!


peaks_output_path <- "PEAKS/multi_file_PEAKS_test.csv"


all_tags <-
  batch_PEAKS_tags(
    PEAKS_output_csv_path = peaks_output_path,
    output_dir = tag_output_folder,
    LC_threshold = 80,
    min_ALC = 50,
    min_tag_length = 5,
    min_peptide_length = 6,
    ppm_error = 15,
    return_tags = TRUE
  )

```



# Uploading tags to database

`sample_id` must be a unique string, if a sample with the same sample_id already
exists in the database it will be overwritten.

If a list is returned by `batch_PEAKS_tags()` the name of each element will be
the value in the Source.File column of the input but with the extension removed.

Uploading tags to database
```{r upload-tags}
purrr::pwalk(
  list(sample_id = names(all_tags), sample = all_tags),
  CandidateSearchDatabase::upload_sample,
  conn = conn_list
)
```


If you need to load the tags from their RData files uncomment then use the below
chunk:

```{r load-tag-Rdata-then-upload}
# tag_paths <- list.files(path = tag_output_folder,
#                         pattern = ".*_tags.RData",
#                         full.names = TRUE)
# #naming each element
# names(tag_paths) <- gsub("_Peaks_tags.RData", "", basename(tag_paths), fixed = TRUE)
# 
# #the name of each element will now be the Source File with the extension removed
# all_tags <- purrr::map(tag_paths, CandidateSearchDatabase::load_rdata_into)
# 
# purrr::pwalk(
#   list(sample_id = names(all_tags), sample = all_tags),
#   CandidateSearchDatabase::upload_sample,
#   conn = conn_list
# )
```



# Downloading database results

Downloading all raw tag-peptide-protein matches as well as tags counts per organism.

If `delete_sample_on_completion = TRUE` (default) then the tags for each sample
will be deleted from the database once the results are downloaded. This prevents
queries from slowing down as the tables that store the sample data get bigger.

```{r download-database-query-results}
result_paths <-
  purrr::map(
    names(all_tags),
    CandidateSearchDatabase::save_database_hits,
    conn_list = conn_list,
    output_dir = database_query_output_folder,
    delete_sample_on_completion = TRUE
  )
```


# Filtering tag matches

Filtering counts for all files
```{r run-filter-counts}
strong_count_files <-
  list.files(path = database_query_output_folder,
             pattern = "*._strong_counts.csv",
             full.names = TRUE)

raw_pep_files <- list.files(path = database_query_output_folder,
             pattern = "*._peptide_matches.csv",
             full.names = TRUE)

filt_count_files <-
  purrr::map2(strong_count_files,
              raw_pep_files,
              filter_counts,
              min_pep_per_prot = 2,
              output_dir = filtered_counts_folder)

```

# Scoring organisms

If `fasta_for_filter_path` is not NULL all tags that are found within the
specified fasta file are removed.

`min_group_hits` is used to filter taxonomic groups before scoring. If a
taxonomic group has total hits < `min_group_hits` it is removed prior to
calculating pos_scores and org_scores. If there is only one taxonomic group that
passes the `min_group_hits` filter then  pos_scores and org_scores won't be
calculated and those columns won't exist in the output.

For more information use `?run_organism_scoring`.

```{r run-scoring}
#overlap matrices and organism_metadata should already be loaded 
filt_files <-
  list.files(path = filtered_counts_folder,
             pattern = "_filt_sample_counts.csv",
             full.names = TRUE)

score_files <- purrr::map(
    filt_files,
    run_organism_scoring,
    fasta_for_filter = "crap.fasta",
    organism_metadata_df = organism_metadata,
    scoring_overlap_mat = overlap_mat_for_scoring,
    output_dir = taxonomic_scores_output_folder,
    Pthrsh = 0.4,
    min_total_tags = 10,
    min_total_strong_tags = 10,
    min_organism_strong_tags = 1,
    min_group_hits = 1,
    export_matrix = TRUE
  )
```



# Generating Heatmaps

## Organism level heatmap
Set `min_pos_score` and `min_org_hits` parameters to prevent too many organisms
from being included in the plot. The values of these parameters will be included
in the output filename.

Use the `overlap_mat` generated in Chunk 4: generate-matrices-and-taxon-groups
to visualize the overlap coefficients based on all peptides. Use the
`overlap_mat_for_scoring` to visualize the overlap coefficients based on strong
peptides only.


```{r}

target_score_file_path <- score_files[[8]]

#load overlap_mat
# load()
  
omap <- organism_heatmap(score_file_path = target_score_file_path,
                      overlap_matrix = overlap_mat,
                      output_dir = "heatmaps",
                      output_type = "png",
                      min_org_hits = 1,
                      min_pos_score = 1,
                      width = 10,
                      height = 7,
                      units = "in")


plot(omap)
```

## Group level heatmap
The `_reduced_matrix.csv` file will be in the `taxonomic_scores_output_folder`
if `export_matrix = TRUE` in the `run_organism_scoring()` call above.

Set the `min_pos_score` parameter to prevent too many organisms
from being included in the plot. The value of this parameter will be included
in the output filename.

```{r}
reduced_matrix_csv <- gsub("organism_scores.csv", 
                           "reduced_matrix.csv",
                           target_score_file_path, 
                           fixed = TRUE)

gmap <- group_heatmap(score_file_path = target_score_file_path,
                      reduced_matrix_path = reduced_matrix_csv,
                      output_dir = "heatmaps",
                      output_type = "png",
                      min_pos_score = 0)

plot(gmap)
```
