# test_uniprot
test runs of MARLOWE with UniProt Database.
Each run starts with an Rmarkdown file such as test_Fish-DeNovo.Rmd
After each code block is run, output is saved to an .html file with the same basename for documentation.
Files generated such as intermediate data are stored in folders: denovo_tags, filtered_counts, taxonomic_scores, heatmaps.
Files needed for initializing are saved in overlap.  Code is saved in R folder. Sample data is stored in PEAKS directory.
